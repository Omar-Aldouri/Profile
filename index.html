      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I am a Digital professional who happens to work as a PM / Agile Coach / Scrum Master. I have over 15 years of experience in agencies and broadcast environments in London. 
      </p><p>
       Some of my skills: Online Agile training workshops / Jira project set-up / Team building / Design Sprints / Facilitating Ad-hoc workshops / Scrum Ceremonies / Coaching Scrum Masters / Remote working best practice and collaboration tools / Product Owner coaching / Team Resilience workshops / Value driven product vision setting / Limiting WIP
      </p>
      <p>
        I help teams and managers in an organisation improve their agility across the board. This is done by working with individuals & teams by connecting them to the organisational vision, metrics and goals. 
I work to improve communication and collaboration to generate transparency. I also work with software teams to help them improve delivery, speed and quality.
